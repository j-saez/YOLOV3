# YOLO V3

This is a YOLO v1 pytorch implementation. The main purpose of this repository was to have a better understanding of the YOLO algorithm and keep forging my pytorch skills.

# Datasets

At the moment, it is only possible to train this algorithm with the VOC and COCO datasets. You can download them from (ADD LINK). Once you have downloaded them, make sure it is placed inside the datasets/data directory. It is not necessary to add it there. If you prefer having the dataset in any other path, add a symbolik link from that path to dataset/data:

```bash
ln -s /path/to/source/directory/VOC <yolov3 repo>/dataset/data/VOC
ln -s /path/to/source/directory/COCO <yolov3 repo>/dataset/data/COCO
```
